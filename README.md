# SilversRRCE
contains scripts used in the analysis for the 2023 paper that compares RCE simulations 
with rotating RCE simulations, referred to as RRCE.

Title: The impact of rotation on tropical climate, the hydrologic cycle, and climate sensitivity
Authors: Levi G. Silvers, Alyssa M. Stansfield, and Kevin A. Reed
Originally submitted to GRL in 2023

the manuscript has been written useing LaTeX.  much of the analysis has been done with 
matlab.   matlab (R2019b) was used to create some of the figures, ncl (NCAR command language) was 
used to create the rest.  

all experiments were performed on the cheyenne computer  and use a 
either the CAM5 or the CAM6 atmospheric climate model.  

these scripts are here for reference.  to use them the data files are needed, and the 
paths to the data would need to be changed appropriately.
